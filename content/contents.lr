body:

I am a Computational Scientist in Glaciology for the [Climate Change
Science Institute](https://climatechangescience.ornl.gov/) at [Oak Ridge National
Laboratory](http://www.ornl.gov/). I develop (primarily) python-based, open-source
scientific software and am currently:

* The technical and visionary lead of [LIVVkit](https://github.com/LIVVkit/LIVVkit), a verification
  and validation toolkit for ice sheet models -- for both stand alone models and those coupled
  to Earth system models.
* [E3SM](https://e3sm.org/) regular staff in the infrastructure group where I work on the case
control system [CIME](https://e3sm.org/resources/tools/other-tools/cime/),  non-bit-for-bit climate
  reproducibility testing with [EVV](https://github.com/LIVVkit/evv4esm), and analysis of E3SM's
  coupled ice sheet model [MALI](https://e3sm.org/resources/tools/diagnostic-tools/mpas-analysis/).
