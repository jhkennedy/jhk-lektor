                Below is a collection of posts I've written mostly to let me think through ideas
                or preserve idea others might find useful. I <em>try</em> to update these posts
                every friday, but life happens some times. <br><br> A quick note about post
                dates: Any posts dated 1970-01-01 (the start of unix time!) are a
                place-holder posts for ideas I plan to come back to.<br><br>
